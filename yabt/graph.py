    """Return a list of nodes in topological sort order.

    This topological sort is a **unique** permutation of the nodes
    such that an edge from u to v implies that u appears before v in the
    topological sort order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : NetworkX digraph
            A directed graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Topological sort is defined for directed graphs only. If the
        graph G is undirected, a NetworkXError is raised.
    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If G is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG) no topological sort
        exists and a NetworkXUnfeasible exception is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    - This algorithm is based on a description and proof in
      The Algorithm Design Manual [1]_ .
    - This implementation is modified from networkx 1.11 implementation [2]_
      to achieve stability, support only reverse (allows yielding instead of
      returning a list), and remove the `nbunch` argument (had no use for it).

    """Helper class for tracking references to targets.

    This class is used mainly for error reporting.
    A single instance represents a single target observed during build graph
    processing (AKA "seed"), in any context, whether valid or not (not
    including syntax error, which are caught and reported during YBuild
    parsing - see buildfile_parser module).

    Currently supprted contexts:
    - `on_cli` - whether this seed was specified on the command line (boolean).
    - `from_default` - whether this seed was specified as one of the "default"
      targets that seed the graph if nothing is specified on the command line.
    - `dep_of` - a set of other seeds that referred to this seed as their
      dependency.
    - `buildenv_of` - a set of other seeds that referred to this seed as their
      buildenv.

    Usage: Through a defaultdict of SeedRefs (mapping from seed name to its
    SeedRef instance) in populate_targets_graph - for every target processed,
    need to add the processed target to all the seeds that that target refers
    to (a reverse index).
    When an error is found, the raise_unresolved_targets function may use the
    mapping to report where an invalid seed was observed.
