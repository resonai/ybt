class BuildContext:
    """Build Context class.

    The framework is designed to operate with a single instance of the
    BuildContext alive, but this is not enforced using a singleton pattern,
    because there's no particular reason to do so...

    While not yet implemented, it is designed to supported concurrent parsing
    of multiple build files using the same build context.
    The design principle to enable this:
    - The "driver" (e.g. main thread in main process) is responsible for
      dispatching build file parsers with copies or references of the build
      context (e.g. on other threads / processes / machines?).
    - Parsers, with their own build context, populate partial target maps.
    - The driver collects the partial results, and is responsible to merge
      them consistently and safely.
    - This will worth it, of course, only if serializing the state to a parser
      and serializing the partial result and merging it back is MUCH cheaper
      than actually doing the parsing, because if it's not, it would be better
      to do it all in the driver (much simpler...) - which is the reason this
      is not yet implemented.
